DEPENDENCIES
    On Ubuntu (and possibly Debian):

        apt-get install libwww-mechanize-perl
        apt-get install libtry-tiny-perl
        apt-get install libdatetime-perl
        apt-get install libjson-perl

    Manually installing the dependencies:

        cpanm DateTime
        cpanm WWW::Mechanize
        cpanm Try::Tiny
        cpanm JSON

    Note: If installing manually, I recommend looking into using perlbrew
          rather than using cpan to install to /usr or /usr/local. In general,
          the best idea is to only install to /usr through your distro's
          package manager.

INSTALLATION
    It's just a script, so copy it to where ever you want it to be (e.g. ~/bin,
    /usr/local/bin, etc...)
